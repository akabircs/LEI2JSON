# csv-publisher
The CSV Publisher is a tool that enables livestock producers to manage their livestock event data efficiently by publishing it in CSV format. The tool uses a Google Spreadsheet as an interface, allowing producers to enter data into a familiar tool, reducing the learning curve for new applications.

The application uses a message broker, such as RabbitMQ, enabling real-time data sharing with consumers, and improving the data flow and connections between producers and consumers. The CSV publisher can be integrated with other software, such as data analysis tools or data visualisation software.
