# PubLEIsh: Publishing Livestock Event Information for Data Sharing

## _Introduction_
The pubLEIsh is a tool that enables livestock producers to manage their livestock event data efficiently by publishing it in JSON format. The tool uses a Google Spreadsheet as an interface, allowing producers to enter data into a familiar tool, reducing the learning curve for new applications.

The application can be configured to use a message broker or API, enabling real-time data sharing with consumers, and improving the data flow and connections between producers and consumers. The pubLEIsh can be integrated with other software, such as data analysis tools or data visualisation software.
