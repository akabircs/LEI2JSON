# LEI2JSON: Livestock Event Information To JSON

## _Introduction_
The LEI2JSON tool enables livestock producers to generate JSON data from a spreadsheet. The tool uses a Google Spreadsheet as an interface, allowing producers to enter data into a familiar tool, reducing the learning curve for new applications.

The application is configured to build a Google sheet template by extracting headers, notes, data type and validation from JSON schema then validation and generation of JSON data with the options to copy, download and save to Google Drive. The LEI2JSON can be integrated with other software, such as data analysis tools or data visualisation software.

## _Tech_
