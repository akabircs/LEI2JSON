# LEI2JSON: Livestock Event Information To JSON

## Introduction

The LEI2JSON tool empowers livestock producers to effortlessly generate JSON data from a spreadsheet. It leverages a Google Spreadsheet as an interface, enabling producers to input data into a familiar tool, reducing the learning curve for new applications.

The application is designed to create a Google sheet template by extracting headers, notes, data types, and validation from a JSON schema. It performs validation and generates JSON data with options to copy, download, and save to Google Drive. LEI2JSON can be seamlessly integrated with other software, such as data analysis tools or data visualization software.
